# Identifying predictors of postoperative blood-related health complications

In this project, I aim to identify reliable predictors of postoperative blood-related health complications, using public datasets collected from 5424 hospitals registered with Medicare in the United States. For each hospital, these datasets record data on HAI, the timeliness and efficacy of care, and complications and death. I start with data wrangling, EDA, and regression analysis. Then, I fit models with bagging, random forests, and XGBoost and evaluate metrics on performance and variable importance.
